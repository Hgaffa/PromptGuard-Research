# PromptGuard

## A Prompt Security and Risk Analysis Engine for LLM Applications

As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in production systems, **prompt injection** and **malicious prompt attacks** present a growing security risk. Traditional input validation techniques are not sufficient to handle the nuanced, adversarial nature of LLM prompts.

**PromptGuard** is a prompt security and analysis engine designed to **detect, score, and mitigate potentially malicious prompts** before they are executed by an LLM.

## Overview

PromptGuard leverages a curated dataset of **40,000+ labelled prompts** to train a machine learning model that estimates the likelihood that a given prompt is malicious. Rather than producing simple binary decisions, PromptGuard provides **probabilistic risk scoring**, enabling flexible and policy-driven enforcement strategies.

The system is built with production use in mind, focusing on reliability, extensibility, and seamless integration into real-world LLM pipelines.

## Features

PromptGuard exposes a production-ready Python API that allows developers to:

- **Classify prompts by maliciousness risk**
- **Perform sentiment and intent analysis**
- **Apply configurable prompt sanitisation strategies**
- **Integrate prompt security checks directly into LLM workflows**

## Design Goals

- Probabilistic risk assessment instead of hard allow/deny decisions
- Modular and extensible architecture
- Low-friction integration with existing LLM systems
- Emphasis on real-world reliability and safety

## Use Cases

- Protecting LLM-powered applications from prompt injection
- Enforcing safety policies in automated workflows
- Auditing and scoring prompts before execution
- Acting as a foundational security layer for LLM-driven automation

## Vision

PromptGuard is intended to serve as a **foundational safety layer** for systems that rely on LLMs, enabling developers to deploy intelligent automation with greater confidence and control.
